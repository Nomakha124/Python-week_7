# Week 7 Python Project: Iris Dataset Analysis

## Description
This project explores the Iris flower dataset using Python. It covers basic data analysis and visualization using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Objectives
- Load and clean a dataset
- Perform basic statistical analysis
- Create insightful data visualizations

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for loading the Iris dataset)

## How to Run
1. Open the `Untitled.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Make sure all plots and outputs are visible.

## Insights
- Virginica species has the longest petals on average.
- Sepal length and petal length are positively correlated.
- Visualizations help clearly separate species by measurements
